#####The feature create account

We have added a function which hasn't been acquired, it's the possibilty
to create an account on the website by clicking on the button create account. 
The user will be able to insert his data (name, email ...).
If the email already exist in the database then 
the a message ("Vous avez d√©ja un compte ") will be displayed, 
otherwise the user will be added to the table Asherent.

To generate an adherent number unique for each user, we use the email
of the user. In fact, we hash the email and extract a number of 
5 digits.
